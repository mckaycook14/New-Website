            <h2>The History of Golf</h2>
            <p>Golf is a sport with a rich history dating back to the 15th century. It originated in Scotland and has become a global pastime.</p>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Origins
                        <ul>
                            <li>Birthplace: Scotland is widely regarded as the birthplace of golf, with the sport tracing its origins back to the 15th century. The earliest records of golf being played date to 1457, when it was mentioned in an Act of the Scottish Parliament as a distraction from archery practice. The iconic St. Andrews Links, established in 1552, became the cradle of modern golf, introducing the standard 18-hole course layout that is still used worldwide today. Scotland's rolling landscapes, combined with its passion for the sport, helped shape golf into a game of skill, strategy, and camaraderie. The nationâ€™s influence remains integral to golf's history, as it continues to host prestigious tournaments, including The Open Championship, the oldest golf competition in the world.</li>
                            <li>Globalization: The spread of golf around the world began in the 19th century as the sport transitioned from its Scottish roots to an international phenomenon. Scottish immigrants and British soldiers played a pivotal role in introducing the game to new regions, establishing courses and clubs across Europe, North America, and the British Empire. By the late 1800s, golf clubs had emerged in countries like the United States, Canada, Australia, and South Africa, with the establishment of prominent institutions such as the United States Golf Association (USGA) in 1894. The development of international competitions, like The Open Championship and later the Ryder Cup, further popularized the game. As technology improved and media coverage expanded in the 20th century, legendary players like Bobby Jones, Arnold Palmer, and Tiger Woods captivated global audiences, cementing golf's status as a worldwide sport that continues to thrive in diverse cultures and settings.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Golf in the Olympics: Golf made its debut in the Olympic Games in 1900 in Paris and was also featured in the 1904 St. Louis Games before being removed from the roster for over a century. After much anticipation, the sport was reintroduced at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics, marking a significant moment for global golf enthusiasts. The Olympic format features a 72-hole stroke play tournament for both men and women, showcasing some of the best talent from around the world. Its inclusion in the Olympics has helped elevate golf's profile, particularly in regions where the sport is less prominent, encouraging more participation and investment in its development. Golf's return to the Olympics celebrates its universal appeal and demonstrates its ability to bridge cultural boundaries, uniting players and fans under the banner of global competition.</li>
                            <li>Famous Golfers: In recent years, several golfers have risen to international fame, captivating fans with their exceptional talent and achievements. Tiger Woods remains one of the most iconic figures in golf, with a remarkable comeback victory at the 2019 Masters after years of injuries and personal challenges. Rory McIlroy, a Northern Irish golfer, has consistently dominated the sport with his powerful drives and impressive Major victories. Spanish sensation Jon Rahm has emerged as one of the top players globally, winning the 2021 U.S. Open and securing the world number-one ranking. Meanwhile, younger stars like Collin Morikawa and Scottie Scheffler have made headlines with their Major wins and poised performances under pressure. On the women's side, players like Nelly Korda, who won gold at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, and Jin Young Ko, with multiple LPGA Major titles, have elevated the sport to new heights. These golfers continue to inspire the next generation, showcasing the evolving landscape of modern golf.</li>

            <h2>Basic Rules of Golf</h2>
            <p>Golf is a game played on a course with 18 holes, where the objective is to hit a small ball into each hole using as few strokes as possible. Players begin each hole from a designated tee area and must follow the course's layout, navigating obstacles like sand traps, water hazards, and trees. The basic rules include playing the ball as it lies, not moving or touching the ball unless permitted (such as for a penalty), and hitting the ball from the tee until it reaches the hole. Players must keep their score by counting the number of strokes taken, with the goal being to complete the course in the lowest number of strokes. Other key rules involve proper etiquette, such as maintaining pace of play, respecting fellow players, and ensuring safety on the course.</p>
